    "To solve the nonlinear problem shown in Figure 2, create a **feature cross**. A feature cross is a synthetic feature that encodes nonlinearity in the feature space by multiplying two or more input features together. (The term cross comes from cross product.) Let's create a feature cross named $x_3$ by crossing $x_1$ and $x_2$ :"

    "We can create many different kinds of feature crosses. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [A X B]: a feature cross formed by multiplying the values of two features.\n",
    "- [A x B x C x D x E]: a feature cross formed by multiplying the values of five features.\n",
